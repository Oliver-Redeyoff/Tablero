## Overview
As developers, we spend most of our day staring at bright crowded displays to get the information that we need, which can be tiring and induce headaches. The advantage of eink displays is that they don't emit any light, instead they reflect ambient light which results in a very natural and paper looking display. We saw this and wanted to use these displays to present information such as the news, notes, todo lists, the weather... so that we don't have to spend even more time looking at bright screens.
